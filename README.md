## Challenge
*Back in the day*, humans would actually leave their homes to go rent a physical video copy of movies (what a strange concept, right?). Blockbuster was the leading video rental company in this era. Today, there is only one Blockbuster location left which is located in Bend, Oregon. We are going to ask you to build a video inventory application for this Blockbuster!

Your Video Inventory Management application should manage the following data:
- Manage customer information:
  - customer id
  - customer account type (sx/px/sf/pf)
    - "sx" = standard account: max 1 rental out at a time
    - "px" = premium account: max 3 rentals out at a time
    - "sf" = standard family account: max 1 rental out at a time AND can not rent any "R" rated movies
    - "pf" = premium family account: max 3 rentals out at a time AND can not rent any "R" rated movies   
  - first name
  - last name 
  - current list of video rentals (*by title*), each title separated by a forward slash "/"
- Manage the store's video inventory:
  - video id
  - video title
  - video rating
  - video release year
  - number of copies currently available in-store

Your application should allow:
- Viewing the current video inventory for the store
- Viewing a customer's current rented videos
  - customer *by id*
  - each title should be listed separately (i.e. not displayed with slashes from the CSV file)
- Adding a new customer
  - you should not have an initial list of video rentals assigned to a newly created customer
  - this should update the relavent CSV file(s)
- Renting a video out to a customer
  - video *by title*
  - customer *by id*
  - **IMPORTANT:** Customers should be limited based on their account type. Your application should enforce these limitations when attempting to rent a video!
  - this should update the relavent CSV file(s)
- Returning a video from a customer
  - video *by title*
  - customer *by id*
  - this should update the relavent CSV file(s)
- Exiting the application

Be sure to give careful consideration into what data structures & data types (including classes) you might need to use in your application logic. Also, your application MUST always keep the CSV data files updated whenever data changes! You need data records to be backed up in a file, in case your application were to crash (and lose data internally).

Your menu should look something like this: 
```
== Welcome to Code Platoon Video! ==
1. View store video inventory
2. View customer rented videos
3. Add new customer
4. Rent video
5. Return video
6. Exit
```
